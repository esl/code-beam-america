This one-day hands-on tutorial introduces participants to GRiSP, GRiSP.io, and Livebook for IoT development. You'll learn to securely connect GRiSP boards to GRiSP.io, use Livebook for real-time sensor and actuator control, and explore secure over-the-air (OTA) updates. Participants will set up a local development environment, deploy their own software over the air, and experiment with IoT applications live using Livebook. Ideal for engineers and developers, this tutorial simplifies cloud-to-edge IoT workflows and distributed computing with real-time data visualization.

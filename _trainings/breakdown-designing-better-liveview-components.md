Break down your LiveViews! If you want to design good live views, you need to know the tools. That means building layered software with components. You can make the most of Phoenix LiveView by understanding the tools at your disposal: live components and function components.

**OBJECTIVES:**
* Explore LiveView components including directives, and slots.
* Understand how to layer code to best take advantage of components.
* Know when to employ stateful components, and when to leave logic and state in the parent view.
* Decorate LiveViews with the proper type and slot macros.

**PREREQUISITES:**
Must know Elixir. Some LiveView experience is preferred but not required.

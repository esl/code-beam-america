Are you looking for the breakthrough that will help take you from intermediate to expert? This course is for you. Explore coding patterns in Elixir and OTP with Elixir. In this two day tutorial, advanced beginners and intermediate programmers will learn the secrets behind building robust, beautifully layered systems.
We'll focus on three fundamental concepts:
- Common patterns for organizing code in Elixir
- Elixir's implementation of concurrency
- The core patterns for fault tolerance in Elixir

Come ready to code. In this training, you'll build a nontrivial application from the inside out. You'll start with a functional core, then add a boundary layer to make the core come to life, and finally a layer to manage the application lifecycle, and restart it should something go wrong. When you're done, you'll have a better understanding of the main software development patterns people use in Elixir every day.
This training covers the everyday use of Elixir, the use case of Livebook in instruction, basic concurrency, application design principles introduced in Designing Elixir Systems with OTP, and patterns for building self-healing software. Many Elixir developers learn Elixir syntax and how to call libraries, never taking the step to understand the layers immediately beneath the surface, especially OTP. This course will break that seal, helping programmers achieve the most critical Elixir breakthrough in the journey from Elixir journeyman to expert.

**Training objectives:**
- Master common patterns for organizing Elixir code
- Understand and implement Elixir's concurrency model
- Learn core patterns for fault tolerance
- Build layered applications with functional core principles
- Gain practical experience with OTP design principles
- Develop self-healing software patterns
- Bridge the gap between intermediate and expert-level Elixir development

**Target audience:**
- Intermediate users, advanced beginners, and intermediate programmers looking to advance their Elixir expertise.

**Training prerequisites:**
- Programming knowledge of Elixir is required
- Elixir Livebook
- Elixir 1.15+ and OTP 26+

Great teams with great tech can do great things and that's unsurprising. Bad tech can be saved by good teams. But can bad teams be saved by great tech? What are the elements that lead to good team performance? 

Smaller communities often frame their stack as some sort of secret sauce that lets them defy expectations. In this talk, we propose that great technological powers only get the opportunity to be leveraged when the proper support systems are in place. If you can't build, buy, and combine these to let your teams be their best selves, it won't matter just how great the tech is.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- bring a focus on key elements of team performance
- introduce a coherent view of observability within organizations
- give people the type of perspective that can make adoption projects successful

**AUDIENCE:**
- Anyone, probably.

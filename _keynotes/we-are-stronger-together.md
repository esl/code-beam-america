The BEAM is living its best days. The ecosystem is thriving, big companies are picking up our languages, innovation is sprawling, and BEAM-based solutions are getting traction in new domains.  
  
But being fragmented, the ecosystem is not as strong as it deserves. There are over 30 languages speaking BEAM, yet only a few can talk to each other. While improvements to Erlang/OTP often trickle down to Elixir and Gleam, the opposite is rarely true. Rewriting everything with Erlang is not an option - we would not rewrite C++ in C either. So what can we do to bring the community together?  
  
We want to talk about the challenges we are facing, the future we envision, and some ideas on how we can step into that future. We want to get you inspired to reunite the ecosystem.

OBJECTIVES

Unite developers working in and on the ecosystem.

AUDIENCE

Any developer working with BEAM

What does a crash in your app mean if it just happens to one person? What if that app is their only way to communicate with the outside world? What does a minor defect in your app mean when it’s supposed to be safeguarding the health of your community?

How does the context of the app change based on who’s using it and why?

This is the human factor—the way that our users and their use cases affect our testing.

Join this speaker as she describes several applications she’s worked on and how the human factor has impacted her team’s testing and their responses to defects. She’ll talk about the human side of use cases from communication to health to music to social media and how we as testers can be better at our jobs with more empathetic testing.

In today's gig economy, workers on platforms like Upwork and Amazon Mechanical Turk face significant challenges. Collective action could improve conditions, but existing systems are inadequate. In my keynote, I will introduce the AI for Worker Collective Action framework, grounded in social theories. This approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and worker-owned data to create worker-centric technologies that empower workers and enhance their conditions. I'll present case studies demonstrating the framework's potential to transform the future of work and conclude with a discussion on a research agenda focused on AI's societal impacts and worker wellbeing.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Inspire people on how they can design AI systems to empower workers and underserved populations.

**AUDIENCE:**

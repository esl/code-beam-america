<p>There are two categories of tickets - for the in-person conference and training and for virtual conference and training attendance.</p>

<p><strong>What does a hybrid event mean?</strong> We’ll be hosting a live event for those who are just as excited as us to attend in person at the conference venue. The talks given at the venue will be streamed to the virtual platform, accessible for those who attend online.</p>

<p><strong>What if I can’t attend in person?</strong> To cater to people’s varying needs, we are continuing to offer this conference as a virtual event, live, on the same day as the in-person conference with talks streamed from the venue.</p>

<p><strong>What if I purchase my ticket and my circumstances change?</strong> Anyone who cannot attend in person can receive a full refund by contacting us up-to a month before the conference or exchange the in-person ticket to a virtual one and receive the reimbursement of the difference in the tickets’ prices.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the Code BEAM America going hybrid?</strong>
We know that not everybody, for a variety of reasons, will be able to travel and meet at big gatherings like Code BEAM. We decided on this format, to make the knowledge accessible to a wide audience, wherever they are based or whatever their budget is.</p>

<p><strong>Why attend the in-person event?</strong>
For some of us, the social experience surrounding the conference is a big part of what makes them so special. While tools like <a href="https://youtu.be/pK1hnGIR0EI">Whova</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/7O2AC4QHfX0">Toucan</a> lounge have helped us replicate a genuine social hallway track, the experience of exploring a new city and going out for dinner long into the evening is one that is better in-person.</p>

<p><strong>Will the virtual content differ from the in-person content?</strong>
The talks and their content will be the same for both the virtual and in-person conferences. We’re working with our technical partners to ensure the quality of live-streamed talks from the in-person venues look and feel similar to the talks at our virtual conferences so far. The slides and the speakers will both be clearly visible to ensure it’s easy for everyone to follow along at home.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the price for the virtual event differ so much for the in-person conference?</strong>
The price of the physical ticket includes the expense of hiring the venue and catering for lunches and breaks throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>As a virtual attendee, how will I be able to interact with speakers and other attendees?</strong>
The <a href="https://youtu.be/pK1hnGIR0EI">Whova app</a> will be in use for both versions of the conference, allowing you to message other users and interact on the community board during breaks and on the talk’s chat during talks. The Q&amp;A tab will allow you and in-person delegates to ask questions to speakers during presentations. To ensure there is still a dynamic networking feel at the conference, virtual attendees will have possibility to create themed virtual meetings to talk to each other on camera.</p>

<p><strong>What time zones will be used?</strong>
Virtual and in-person talks will take place at the same time on two tracks (9:00-17:00) in the Pacific Time zone.</p>

<p><strong>How can I give a talk at this year’s event?</strong>
Call for talks will be open according to the information on the website. We will consider talks from speakers who can attend in person only.</p>

<p><strong>If I register to the in-person event will I be able to alter my choice?</strong>
Yes, all ticket holders will be able to change from an in-person to a virtual ticket up-to a month before the conference without any costs. Closer to the event it’s also possible, but it’s not fully refunded - see the refund policy on Eventbrite.</p>

<p><strong>If I submit to the virtual event will I be able to alter my choice?</strong>
If you purchased a virtual ticket and you would like to exchange it to an in-person one closer to the event, you will have to ask for a refund and purchase the in-person ticket separately.</p>

<p><strong>Will the videos from the talks be public after the event?</strong>
Yes, talks from this event will be published on our YouTube channel and website following the event, some videos will be kept exclusive to attendees who purchased a ticket for the first 3 months.</p>

<p>We look forward to sharing an event worth celebrating with you later this year as we bring the community together, in person for a long overdue reunion.

<p><br />
We’ve got you covered. We’ve been singing from the LiveView hymn sheet for years now
and we’re pretty confident that you could become a LiveView evangelist too but first, here’s why we think it’s so great:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, LiveView is essentially an expansive library that lends itself to rich real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML</li>
  <li>It offers a greatly simplified programming model when compared to JavaScript alternatives and LiveView-powered applications are stateful on the server with bidirectional communication through WebSockets</li>
  <li>LiveView singlehandedly transcended what developers thought of Elixir worldwide</li>
  <li>Finally, it set the path for moving Elixir from a server-side technology to the powerful full-stack ecosystem that it is today.</li>
</ul>

<p>So without further ado here are some brilliant videos we’ve collected over the years from past ElixirConf events on Phoenix LiveView:</p>

These frameworks open doors to the community and expand the capabilities of the ecosystem, making it easier for even more developers to do a wider array of tasks in Elixir. At our June edition, we heard first hand about the updates, capabilities and future plans for five exciting new frameworks. If you’re always looking for new projects or ways to expand your Elixir skill set, make sure you <a href="https://www.elixirconf.eu/#register" title="tickets">get tickets to our next edition of ElixirConf EU Virtual on October 7-8.</a></p>

<p>If you missed the June event, you can catch up on the latest frameworks below.</p>

<p><strong>Crawly - Oleg Tarasenko</strong></p>

<p>Big data is a growing area of interest and investment for businesses around the world. From machine learning to research, the ability to gather broad, reliable datasets is in high demand. Crawly, is a new Elixir framework that allows you to perform data scraping activities using Elixir. Hear from its creator, Oleg Tarasenko below. And, if that interests you, you can view a walkthrough of how to complete a task using crawly on the<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/webinars.html#how-to-use-web-scraping-in-elixir-to-gather-useful-data-erlang-solutions-webinar-58"> Erlang Solutions webinar.</a></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Scenic - Boyd Multerer</strong></p>

<p>Created by Boyd Multerer (the inventor of Xbox Live), the Scenic framework is a native graphic interface for Elixir. Scenic gives Elixir developers the ability to easily build applications that operate identically across all supported operating systems, including MacOS, Ubuntu, Nerves/Linux, and more. Scenic’s main focus is IoT devices but it can also be used to build portable applications. In his talk, Boyd looks to the future of Scenic and fills you in on changes you can look forward to in the upcoming updates. Learn more in the video below.</p>

<p><strong>Lumen - Hans Elias Josephsen</strong></p>

<p>Lumen is the latest Elixir framework to improve the ease of use for front-end use cases. It is a new compiler and runtime suitable for any BEAM language that is compatible with WebAssembly. In this talk, Hans introduces the Lumen project with a specific focus on the compiler.</p>

<p><strong>Membrane Framework - Marcin Lewandowski</strong></p>

<p>Media processing requires a large amount of data, a huge variety of formats, protocols and standards. This has always made it challenging to work with.

<strong>Pelemay - Susumu Yamazaki</strong></p>

<p>Pelamay has been available since mid-May 2020. It can compile Enum.map in parallel with an integer and (or) a float calculation or String.replace into native code with SIMD instructions. The result is an increase in speed from Enum of between2.25x to 4.48x. In this talk, Susumu Yamazaki, Pelemay’s co-creator shows of what Pelemay can do with demonstrations as well as discussing something that we will see in the near future.</p>

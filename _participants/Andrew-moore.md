I live in Pagosa Springs, Colorado with my lovely partner, our 9-year-old son, our cat Nina, and our pet rats Cliffy and Admiral Whiskers. I began my career as a Front End web developer working on a React application and was offered an apprenticeship position in Elixir with LaunchScout, and the rest is history unwritten.

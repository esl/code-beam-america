I have over 13 years of experience in Software Engineering, Leadership, Business Development, and Digital Products.

I co-founded Plataformatec, a software consultancy that was acqui-hired by Nubank in 2020. The company grew to R$ 20 million in revenue and had over 65 people working with clients such as Nubank, Bionexo, Youse, Abril, Locaweb, Easynvest, and Walmart.

Throughout this growth, I gained experience as an individual contributor and manager in software engineering, sales, business development, and SaaS products.

Plataformatec was also known worldwide for being the company behind the Elixir programming language.

After Plataformatec, I started SourceLevel, a tech-based startup focused on metrics and analytics for Engineering Teams, which is currently in its early stage.

My main programming languages are Ruby and Elixir, and I usually contribute back to open-source projects.

CEO / Co-founder @ Massdriver. DevTools and platform engineering enthusiast. I've been building teams/startups, developing and managing cloud operations for over 20 years. Creator of the Bonny, an Elixir-based Kubernetes operator framework. A proponent of Friday deploys.

I'm a taco snob, cloud archaeologist, and Kubernetes whisperer.

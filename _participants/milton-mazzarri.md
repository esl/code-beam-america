Milton is a Systems Engineer and an enthusiast of the Free/Libre Open Source Software philosophy.

He left his homeland (Venezuela) more than a decade ago and began exploring other opportunities worldwide. He worked for some years in Mexico, and now he works in the United States of America, always doing what he likes, software development.

Among the things he likes the most are reading books, mainly in the science-fiction, biography, history, or technical categories. He also enjoys sharing time with family and friends, playing tennis, going for a bike ride, playing football, or just running near home. But, of course, he's also passionate about Computer Science and Programming Languages.

Sylvia graduated from Brigham Young University-Idaho this past December. In addition to a love of functional programming and arguing about naming conventions they have a passion for audio, cooking, and any night of good games with friends.

Sylvia has a spouse and two children, ages 3 years and 6 months. Their 3YO didn't have a "why phase, he had a "but how does that work" phase. Sylvia likes to think that's a result of their influence.

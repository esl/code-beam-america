He's the maintainer of a lot of open-source projects and tools that you probably use every day, if you work with Erlang.
He's a very prolific blogger and trainer and he used to organize SpawnFest.
When not working with Erlang, you can find him playing table tennis or walking around the Spanish country-side with his family.

Pablo Costas Sánchez is a Software Engineer deeply interested in creating, maintaining, and shipping distributed software; he also enjoys his fair share of testing (with a special love for Property-Based Testing). He is currently an active member of Erlang Ecosystem Foundation, specially in the Education working group. In his free time, you will most probably find him rollerblading around the city.

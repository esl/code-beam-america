Kent is an operating-systems engineer specialized in formally verifiable trustworthy systems using seL4. His interests include systems engineering and how using different operating system architectures can help construct trustworthy applications.   
  
His work at Kry10 is focused on designing and developing the new Kry10 secure platform which includes a new device operating system, KOS, that leverages seL4 and the BEAM to make it easier to build and maintain embedded software that still needs to be secure and robust even if it’s connected to the internet.  
  
He previously worked at the Trustworthy Systems Research Group at CSIRO's Data61 where he helped oversee the technical development of seL4 as an OS engineer. He is currently a member of the seL4 Foundation’s technical steering committee.

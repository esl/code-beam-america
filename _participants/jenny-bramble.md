Jenny ended up in engineering leadership after coming up through support and devops, cutting her teeth on that interesting role that acts as the 'translator' between customer requests from support and the development team. Her love of support and the human side of problems lets her find a sweet spot between empathy for the user and empathy for her team. She's done testing, support, or human interfacing for most of her career. She finds herself happiest when she's making an impact on other people - whether it's helping find issues in applications, leading scrum, speaking at events, or just grabbing coffee and chatting.

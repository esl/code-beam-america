I’m a Senior Software Developer and Computer Engineer with 9 years of full experience in the IT industry, with passion for learning cutting-edge technologies.

I’ve participated in more than 10 projects in cross-functional teams between 6 and 12 people, with clients like Paypal, Ancestry, Salesforce, Mercedes Benz, Bancolombia, just to name a few, so I feel comfortable being involved in industries like Software, Health, Finance, Energy.

In my latest projects I met Elixir and I just fell in love with this functional programming language, and how complex problems can be solved in a fancy way, tackling situations like high availability, concurrency and distributed systems.

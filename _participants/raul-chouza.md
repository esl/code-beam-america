While at a desk RaÃºl spends his time getting into rabbit-holes that make him better understand complexity ðŸŒ€

He enjoys the nuances of programming but would like programs to tell you more, especially when they go wrong. Exploring erlang, elixir and gleam does fulfill a bit of that âœ¨

Otherwise, loves trying out traditional food; sharing evenings with friends; gaming; has a small family with wife, baby and cat ðŸ¦¦

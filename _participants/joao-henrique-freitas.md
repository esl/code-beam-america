I started learning Erlang/OTP in 2010 after some experiences adding Erlang Megaco/H.248 application to an embedded product. Well, the attempt has failed but my persistence to keep using Erlang/OTP and function programming continued over the years. Nowadays, I work full time with Erlang/OTP implementing controller application for OTN (Optical Transport Network) products.

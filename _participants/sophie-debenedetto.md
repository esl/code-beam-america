Sophie is an engineer at GitHub and co-author of Programming Phoenix LiveView. She is a graduate of, and former teacher at, The Flatiron School and has a passion for coding education. That passion, plus her love of Elixir, has also led her to become a maintainer of Elixir School, a free, open-source Elixir curriculum. She also participates in an Elixir mentoring program and is always seeking opportunities to help others learn and grow. Historically she is a cat person but will admit to owning a dog.

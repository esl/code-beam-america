Eric came to programming after wandering through a number of other fields and attempts at careers. After a decade of Ruby development he made the jump to Elixir, and has not looked back since. In the past few years he has mostly worked on high-volume data processing applications, though he also cares about appearances and can spend hours tweaking typographical styles.

Away from computers, he loves playing music, practicing martial arts, snuggling with cats, and in general being around people who care about what they do.

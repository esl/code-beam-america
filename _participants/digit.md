A self-described "hyper-generalist" Digit has been hacking up all sorts of projects throughout his life including IoT hardware, graphics, embedded systems, developer tools, game engines, and interactive web applications.

He currently maintains the Elixir Burrito project, and contributes occasionally to the Nerves community as well.

When he's not programming you'll find him perfecting his morning espresso shot, exploring the PNW, or playing table top games.

Digit is currently a Senior Firmware Engineer @ SmartRent.

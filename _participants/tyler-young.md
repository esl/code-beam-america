I’m a full-stack Elixir developer building my own software-as-a-service platform for monitoring clients' web sites. In the past, I’ve worked in a number of soft real-time, distributed systems domains, including collaborative mapmaking, flight simulation, networking, video streaming, and IOT command-and-control systems. I fell in love with the Elixir language in 2019, when I used it to build a massively multiplayer game server for the X-Plane flight simulator, and I’ve been working primarily with Elixir ever since.

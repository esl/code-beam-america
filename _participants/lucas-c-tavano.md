I'm Brazilian, living in Curitiba, PR. Started my interest in development since I was just a child, playing with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.  
  
Started studying Computer Engineering at (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná) in 2015 and since then never left this path till today.   
  
I've been hired as a software engineer for the first time in 2017, starting my career in embedded systems with Python and Shell, then moving to PHP and Elixir as a back-end developer for 3 years, and at last, I've fully focused my career on being an Elixir back-end developer for the last year.

John Mandalakas is a software developer at NFI Industries, where he has been using elixir to build out an event-driven logistics system for the last six years. 

About a decade ago, he escaped a harrowing career in international finance by attending Dev Bootcamp, where an instructor once showed him Racket; he has been hooked on functional programming since that moment. 

When not coding in esoteric programming languages, he is spending time with his family, riding bikes, cooking, exploring forests, or pretending to farm in his backyard.

Twenty eight years ago, I entered the industry. In that time, I've been a senior software engineer, a junior programmer, a CEO, a product manager, an independent consultant, and pretty much everything in-between these. I have worked on mission-critical software for the semiconductor industry and began my own mobile-software startup company. Now I am a Professor of Computer Science and work to bring all those experiences into the classroom to help others succeeded in and love our industry.

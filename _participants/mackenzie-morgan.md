Mackenzie has been known to joke about being "_really_ full stack," from the browser all the way down to the Linux kernel. But now in the 2020s, her days as an Ubuntu Developer are long in the past, and (like so much of the industry) she's hanging out around web servers. After being introduced to Elixir in 2020 to solve a major performance issue, Mackenzie discovered that functional programming works with her brain in a way object-oriented programming never did. (This came as a surprise! The first time someone tried to get her to try FP, it was a Haskell programmer saying scary words like "lambda calculus.") When not writing code, Mackenzie studies and recreates 16th-century clothing, shoots archery, and gets chased by that darned green owl.

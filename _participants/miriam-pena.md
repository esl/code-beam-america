I love architecting distributed, highly scalable and highly available systems written in Erlang. I have been an Erlang engineer for +16 years in companies all over the World, including automakers in Detroit, real time bidding advertising infrastructure in Dublin & San Francisco, social network messaging (with Ejabberd!) in Madrid, telcos in Stockholm & Egypt, embedded control systems for renewable energy power plants in Spainâ€¦

I am a founding member and have been a board member for the last 5 years of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation and I have co-organized the Erlang & Elixir meetup in San Francisco for 2 years.

Tom and Emily are cofounders of the Open Landscape Network. Passionate about the intersection of environmentalism and technology, they saw the environmental sector was lagging in technical innovation, despite the climate and biodiversity crisis being some of the most significant challenges of our time.

The organization now supports projects in multiple countries to develop and scale their efforts, while demonstrating the potential of cross-stakeholder collaboration.

Adopting the BEAM in an organization can be a game-changer, offering fault tolerance, concurrency, and scalability that are hard to match. However, introducing the BEAM into an existing ecosystem often faces challenges like resistance to change, lack of familiarity, and integration complexity. In this talk, we'll explore how test automation can serve as a bridge to overcome these barriers, driving smoother BEAM adoption within your organization.

The talk will cover why test automation is a good way to introduce the BEAM into an organization and one example of when it has been done.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Sharing one way of getting the BEAM into an organization.

**AUDIENCE:**
- Anyone that would like to spread the BEAM to more organizations.

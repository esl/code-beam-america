What if your application could engage in natural conversation with users and stakeholders? This talk explores how combining Ash Framework's powerful introspection capabilities with GenAI and modern LLMs creates a new possibility in application development â€“ one where applications become intelligent conversational partners rather than static interfaces.

Traditional applications force users to learn their interfaces, navigate complex menus, and adapt to rigid workflows. But what users really want is to ask questions and get things done. This talk demonstrates how combining Ash Framework's comprehensive application introspection with GenAI creates applications that users can simply talk to.

**TALK OBJECTIVE:**
We want the audience to rethink how software might be built. We'll introduce the basics of Ash for those who are new and look at how we can connect Ash's introspectibility with LLMs.

We'll explore:
- How Ash's DSL compilation and introspection capabilities create a foundation for smarter AI-enabled applications
- Practical examples of dynamic, conversation-driven interfaces
- Real-world implementations of natural language queries for answering user questions
- The future of application development where UIs become fluid, adaptive conversations

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Developers building business applications with Elixir and Phoenix, but should have broad appeal since we're looking at how LLMs may affect how we build software systems.

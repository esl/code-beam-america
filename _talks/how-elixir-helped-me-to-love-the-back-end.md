---
As someone whose main language was Javascript, I used to dread the backend. I would create the bare minimum and then set my focus on the frontend. Now that I use Elixir, however, I love working in the backend. This talk focuses on how Elixir makes the backend easy and intuitive and much less intimidating for anyone who shied away from the backend before.

**Talk objectives:**

This talk aims to help earlier developers gain the confidence to explore an area of the code they may find intimidating and to give a starting point on how to explore the backend and Elixir, as well as discuss the differences that make Elixir a great language for the backend.

**Target audience:**

Younger developers who are still picking a language or anyone who finds the backend intimidating, unapproachable, or uninteresting.

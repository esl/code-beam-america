Diving into a new language can be pretty daunting. Falling into a new language by accident? That's a completely different story.

This talk will discuss how a series of unexpected events led to a career in Gleam, highlighting the lessons learned along the way, Gleam's strengths - and its pitfalls - and how to write production-ready Gleam code.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Talk about my journey from Python, TypeScript etc. to Gleam
- Show that Gleam has a very low barrier to entry
- Demonstrate Gleam's production readiness
- Show how my Gleam code has evolved over time, and talk about some Gleam best practices

**AUDIENCE:**
The BEAM-curious or the existing BEAMers who are new to Gleam and want to see how they could progress to being true Gleamlins.

In our diverse digital world, handling multilingual data in databases presents unique challenges that often go unnoticed until they cause critical issues. This talk aims to shed light on the challenges of handling character set encodings in different SQL databases. We'll dive into the complexities of Unicode support in database systems, examining how seemingly simple concepts like string length and case sensitivity become multifaceted problems when dealing with diverse character sets. This problem will be examined through the lens of a database virtualization platform written in Erlang.

Key sections of this talk will include:
    1. Identifying and diagnosing Unicode-related issues in databases
    2. Guidelines for writing robust tests to guard against encoding problems
    3. Understanding the impact of default settings and implicit resolution rules
    4. Implementing best practices for Unicode support in database design and querying

**OBJECTIVES:**
To share learnings about working with unicode data in dissimilar database systems in Erlang

**AUDIENCE:**
People interested in interactive with different database system in non-latin languages through Erlang

How can we simplify IoT development, make edge computing more accessible, and do it all with a few lines of code? By integrating Livebook with GRiSP.io, we're making the future of distributed computing more approachable, interactive, and collaborative.

I'll show how to use Livebook to run distributed applications on GRiSP boards, build real-time dashboards, and manage cloud-to-edge communications easily. You'll be able to tweak edge computing algorithms, run experiments on distributed nodes, and share everything with your team in real-time.

This talk is for anyone curious about building smarter IoT applications with less hassle. We'll cover examples of edge computing, fog networks, and distributed workflows, and how Livebook and GRiSP can bring your IoT ideas to lifeâ€”making distributed computing real, interactive, and intuitive.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Understand how Livebook and GRiSP simplify cloud-to-edge IoT development.
- See practical examples of distributed computing and real-time data visualization.
- Learn how to turn ideas into working prototypes faster, without needing low-level hardware expertise.

**AUDIENCE:**
- Researchers interested in prototyping and deploying IoT systems without dealing with low-level hardware complexities.
- Engineers looking to leverage edge and cloud-to-edge computing for distributed workflows and real-time data visualization.
- Developers familiar with Erlang or Elixir and curious about building smarter, interactive IoT applications efficiently.
- Anyone in the IoT space wanting to explore new tools and methods for simplifying the development and management of distributed IoT systems.

The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF) has just turned 5 years old, and it has been a whirlwind! Come and join us to recap some of the coolest EEF-funded/driven initiatives that you use every day, from faster rebar 3 builds, a JIT compiler optimized for arm64 that is saving the planet to smoother documentation navigation that is there to save our day. But that's not all â€“ we've also been hard at work fostering a more diverse and inclusive community. As we unravel these achievements, let's also explore upcoming opportunities to collaborate, build and continue support. Find out how you can play a vital role in strengthening our community together!

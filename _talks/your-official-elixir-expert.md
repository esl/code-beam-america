The official LSP implementation is going to send the Elixir developer experience to the moon!

We've seen TWO new language server implementations, Next LS and Lexical, enter the fray alongside Elixir LS, the existing community project.

Now, the three projects are fusing to become the official LSP team and bring to you an official LSP implementation, *project codename*.

Let's dive into the technical strengths of each of the projects, the Elixir and OTP improvements, and the future of the Elixir IDE experience.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- To introduce and explain the official LSP implementation for Elixir and its impact on the developer experience.

**AUDIENCE:**
- Elixir developers interested in IDE tooling and development experience improvements.

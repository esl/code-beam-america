Modern testing frameworks offer plentiful options for structuring your tests. This flexibility is powerful but can quickly become overwhelming. How do you choose the right approach? Should you use multiple setup blocks? Are fixtures the right choice? And what about testing code that spawns stateful processes?

This talk will address these questions and more, drawing from the speaker's extensive testing experience. We'll explore strategies to help you:

1. Choose the most effective test structure for your project
2. Optimize your testing process for speed and clarity
3. Handle complex scenarios, including stateful processes

This talk aims to provide practical strategies for creating clearer, more efficient tests that streamline development processes. The talk will focus on Elixir, but many of the techniques are broadly applicable across the entire BEAM ecosystem.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- This talk aims to provide practical strategies for creating clearer, more efficient tests that streamline development processes. It will equip developers with multiple strategies (and knowledge to help them choose between them) to handle a wide variety of testing scenarios, from end-to-end tests to unit test.

**AUDIENCE:**
- Anyone who writes tests for writing software (which I think should be nearly everyone!). I think there will be content that will be interesting to beginners, as well as senior developers.

After the aquisition of Frame.io by Adobe, priorities shifted. From being a startup, we were catapulted to a world of enterprise software development, with the potential of a 10x increase in volumes. Our first priority was tackling technical debt so as to allow us to scale and integrate with their other products.  
  
In this talk, we will share some of the technical challenges we faced with a 6 year old Elixir code base and how we dealt with them. From internal code changes, improvements in stability, observability, the database layer, and of course, scalability. These initial improvements allowed us to replace some of the in-house applications with OSS and other Professional packages like Oban Pro+Web, and Broadway. In this talk, you will learn not only how to deal with technical debt, but also how to deal with management, getting them involved in the process and giving you the bandwidth you need to address the issues.

OBJECTIVE

Show how the team behind Frame.io gained stability, observability and scalability after focusing on paying its technical debt in a six-year-old codebase. And how tackling issues directly in our often neglected RDBMS resulted in immediate benefits.

AUDIENCE

Elixir Developers, Database (PostgreSQL) analysts

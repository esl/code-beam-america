Reservation management can be tricky with hundreds or even thousands of people requesting the same time slot concurrently. This talk aims to showcase the power of event sourcing through OTP using a reservation app written with LiveView. We'll go through the implementation and then do a live demo with the audience while monitoring performance.

**OBJECTIVES:**
Showcase the power of event sourcing and handling hundreds of concurrent requests.

**AUDIENCE:**
Technology and IT Specialists: Those involved in developing and implementing real-time platform integrations and utilizing technologies like GenServers for data processing.

When we think of "DevOps", we imagine the centre of a Venn diagram where there is a clear intersection between dev and ops teams. But decision fatigue and the perceived complexity of the operations world have caused these teams to drift apart.

We'll talk about the principles that efficient teams should embody to bridge this separation, and how encouraging developers to understand deployment will improve performance and happiness.

BEAM technologies are fault tolerant and reliable by design, and you and your development teams should be the same. Having knowledge of all parts of the software delivery process means that you'll be able to share responsibilities and work together more efficiently. So we'd like to empower you to leave your comfort zone, jump over the fence and learn something new.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- We want the people attending our talk to understand 5 key principles that will help their teams work more efficiently. We'd love for people to leave with a less individualistic mindset and have empathy for everyone on their team.

**AUDIENCE:**
- Anyone as we are trying to help teams in general. Even if people are "not interested in DevOps", they could still get a lot out of our talk.

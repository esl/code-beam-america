I'll talk about how we used Elixir at Positron to accelerate the process of developing machine learning hardware.  The BEAM VM offers some incredible advantages in servicing ML workloads and I'll be talking about these advantages as I see them.  Especially as the current state of the art tends to use python, I'll make some specific comparisons there.

**OBJECTIVES:**
I'll talk about upstack and downstack advantages to using elixir to servicing and deploying modern machine learning workloads.

**AUDIENCE:**
Developers interested in leveraging AI.  Developers interested in interfacing with low level programmers.

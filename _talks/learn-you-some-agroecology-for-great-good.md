This talk is about the base foundation of most modern technology: agriculture.

Beginning in human prehistory, we venture through time, exploring how agriculture first came to be, and how it has evolved into its current dominant form(s). Using programming paradigms as analogies we will discuss where things stand and how they might want to change in order to improve sustainability of human societies. If this wasn’t already cool enough, we will get to see some pictures of my family’s backyard chickens.

But most importantly, we will discuss why erlang and distributed systems generally could be considered a desirable future model for climate resilience in agriculture, and how we as technologists might be uniquely positioned to enable that possibility.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Provide an entertaining and interesting overview of agricultural technology
- Address climate change and the risks it poses to food systems in a fun and positive manner
- Catalyze discussion on how technologists can contribute to sustainability in food and agriculture

**AUDIENCE:**
- Primarily erlang and elixir developers, but also gardeners, chicken enthusiasts, and anyone worried about or interested in climate change.

As someone who models, dances, and draws in my spare time, the movement of bodies is fascinating and complicated. AI might still have trouble knowing how many fingers a person should have, but with Liveviews’ open socket design and Bumblebee’s neural network capability guided by an artistic engineer, we can make some motion magic.

**OBJECTIVES:**
This talk aims to demystify machine learning and image/video manipulation in the hopes of making it understandable and approachable to anyone who is interested in starting.

**AUDIENCE:**
Elixir engineers who are interested in machine learning or motion tracking but are intimidated by the process or are not sure where to start.

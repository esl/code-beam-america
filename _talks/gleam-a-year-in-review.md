Gleam released version 1 almost exactly one year ago, on March 4th 2024. Version 1 was a statement of stability and production readiness, but that doesn't mean work was finished!

Many BEAMers not actively following Gleam's development may not know just how far we've come: join me as we look back on a year of development and see how the language and ecosystem have grown, gain some insights into Gleam's community and how it is working for the BEAM, and set our sights on the future for another year of shining bright âœ¨

**OBJECTIVES:**
- Get the BEAM community up to speed on everything that has happened over the last year in Gleam, there's a lot!

**AUDIENCE:**
- A lot of BEAMers have been interested or following Gleam from the sidelines but may not be keeping up to date with everything that's been going on. The target audience is anyone interested in a quick roundup of all the exciting bits of news over the last 12 months.

In this talk, we will cover multiple areas in WhtasApp's infrastructure related to the lifecycle of a request flowing between our Erlang services. It incudes how to overcome the limitation and scale our cluster to more than 40 thousand nodes using Erlang Distribution, the service discovery and routing mechanism, the job dispatching and queueing model, as well as the bottlenecks and overload protections. We welcome you to come and learn on  how to build Erlang infrastructure at scale.

**AUDIENCE:**
Developers who are interested in large scale Erlang clusters

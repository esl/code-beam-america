AI and LLM powered applications are poised to become the next big thing in software. All of the incredible advancements in the last few years have created the foundational layers of AI. In this talk, we will take a hands-on approach to using these foundations directly in our Elixir/Phoenix based applications.

**Talk objectives:**

What to expect: This will NOT be a math heavy talk about AI/ML itself. It will be the practical side of using AI/LLMs within Elixir apps. All the code examples will be Elixir.

What they will learn: They will learn the HOW and WHAT. Attendees will leave the talk with a clear idea of how they could immediately integrate AI/LLMs into their apps (HOW). The overall conversation will also provide product ideas of real world examples that should stimulate ideas on what are good ideas with the current toolsets (WHAT).

**Target audience:**

Developers and Product owners, who want to “get into AI” but don’t know where to start.

We will discuss how to do it but examples will entice product people who want to learn more about what is possible.

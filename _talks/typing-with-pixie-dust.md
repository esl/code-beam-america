Legacy code. It can be...fragile. It really helps if you can already be sure what types your functions expect and return, but what if past-you didn't include type specs, making life harder for now-you?  
  
Thankfully, TypEr already exists, but what if we could sprinkle on some pixie dust and make it more automagic? There's a Rebar3 plugin for that! Come learn about the tools used to create that plugin, discoveries along the way, and enhancements made to TypEr in the process.

OBJECTIVE

Increase the likelihood people will start using type specs if they aren't yet, and also demonstrate the ease of creating new rebar3 plugins using the rebar3 plugin framework.

AUDIENCE

Developers dealing with legacy code and rebar3

The Nerves platform, framework, and tooling provide a highly specialized environment for using Elixir to build advanced embedded devices in industries worldwide. But can Nerves also make a puppet dance?   
  
In this talk, I'll share my experience as a second-generation puppeteer building interactive animatronics with Nerves. If you've ever wanted to automate a lawn decoration, create a haunted house in your garage, or code a small, silly project to give someone joy during a challenging time, this talk may be for you.

AUDIENCE

Anyone interested in Nerves, IoT, or puppetry

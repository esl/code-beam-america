A year and a half ago a couple of apprentices and a supporting cast of mentors began working on a LiveView application. We recently launched that LiveView application into production. Let us tell you the tale of how we learned Elixir and the Phoenix Framework, and how we were able to turn that LiveView application into mobile apps that recently launched in the Google Play and Apple App Stores.

OBJECTIVES

\-To show how to turn a Phoenix application into something suitable for submission to the app stores.  
  
\-Share our Apprenticeship experiences and learning paths up to this point.  
  
\-Show how viable Elixir is as a great learning language.

In this presentation, we embark on a journey through the dynamic landscape of the Internet of Things. We will delve into the crucial role of multiprotocol gateways and companion ecosystem devices, examining their impact on the development and deployment of comprehensive hardware-software solutions. We will also share our firsthand experience in successfully traversing continents to deliver these solutions.

Our exploration begins with a refined understanding of IoT, encompassing trending concepts such as Edge AI/ML and heterogeneous computing. This reframed perspective paves the way for a deeper appreciation of the complex ecosystem in which our solutions operate. We then proceed to dissect the intricate architecture and implementation of multiprotocol gateways and sensor devices, utilising the ESL Reference IoT platform as a tangible case study. This detailed examination illuminates the interplay between diverse hardware and software components, and how we leverage BEAM technologies to orchestrate them seamlessly.

We also go through the journey of prototyping and shipping tangible hardware products, co-developed across continents, using the latest tools and services available for small scale hardware delivery.

**OBJECTIVES:**
This technical presentation offers an in-depth analysis of current IoT trends, with a focus on the design and implementation of custom IoT hardware and software solutions.

**AUDIENCE:**
* Embedded developers interested in exploring the use of the BEAM in constrained environments
* Elixir and Erlang developers interested in:
- The use of OTP in a different domain and on different architectures
- Understanding the hardware development and manufacturing journey

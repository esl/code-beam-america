LiveView gives us immense productivity as Elixir developers building web applications. What do we do when we need to go past what LiveView gives us? In this session, we'll explore why using Web Components can be the perfect way to extend LiveView with custom or existing javascript in a way that still feels like LiveView. We'll see how LiveElements lets us turn our web components into LiveView functional components. We'll work through examples of using existing web components, building our own from scratch, and using web components to "wrap" existing javascript libraries.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- To give Elixir/LiveView developers a great option for extending LiveView with custom javascript in an ergonomic way.

**AUDIENCE:**
- Elixir/LiveView developers

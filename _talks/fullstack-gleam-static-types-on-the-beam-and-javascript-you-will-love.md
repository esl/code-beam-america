Learn how to use Gleam, a friendly type safe language that compiles to Erlang and JavaScript, to build maintainable and performant full stack applications. In this talk you will learn what typed OTP looks like in Gleam, and how leveraging Gleam's two compilation targets leads to both an enjoyable developer and user experience.

**TALK OBJECTIVE:**
- This talk aims to show how easy it is to build a non trivial full stack application in Gleam by taking advantage of both the existing libraries and paradigms we enjoy from Erlang and Elixir, while also easily tapping into what JavaScript has to offer on the frontend.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- This talk would appeal to people who are interested in or already love taking advantage of everything the BEAM has to offer but misses the static typing other languages have to offer.
- Alternatively I think this talk would be interesting to people who are already using Erlang/Elixir for fullstack development but aren't completely satisfied with the state of the frontend part of the equation.

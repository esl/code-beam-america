An overview of my journey learning Gleam, Erlang and AtomVM for creating a Micro-controller framework for ESP32 and Raspberry PICO devices. This talk will discuss the tools and knowledge acquired while achieving the completion of embedded hobby prototypes under the new framework. For demonstrating the developer experience we're going to give an overview of the tools created and simple code examples.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- This talk aspire to give an overview on the process to learn Gleam while working on a medium open source project that is a framework for micro-controller/embedded programming.
- Also it should give an idea of the challenges using the "young" Gleam ecosystem and how running the exported BEAM VM files compares against other more known paths, like system programming languages (rust, C/C++) or Python for embedded devices.

**AUDIENCE:**
The talk should be a good match for people who has none or minimum knowledge of embedded/micro-controllers devices and are interested on using a type system language that runs in the BEAM VM on energy efficient devices.

---
This talk explores the inner workings of PubSub and its crucial role in building scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time systems.

It begins with an introduction to the Publisher/Subscriber pattern, highlighting how it decouples services and facilitates efficient message broadcasting in distributed architectures.

The session then delves into Phoenix.PubSub, showing how it powers real-time features in LiveView and handles clustering across multiple nodes.

Two hands-on examples will demonstrate PubSub in action: a GenServer broadcasting state across nodes using libCluster, and real-time updates between LiveComponents and LiveView.

Perfect for Elixir developers looking to master PubSub and build resilient, scalable applications.

**OBJECTIVES:**
The talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how PubSub works within the Elixir ecosystem and why mastering it is essential for building scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time systems. It seeks to demystify the Publisher/Subscriber pattern, showing its importance in decoupling services and enabling distributed architectures.

Through real-world examples and practical demonstrations, the talk will empower attendees to effectively leverage Phoenix.PubSub, understand its role in clustering, and implement PubSub to solve real-time communication challenges in their own projects.

**AUDIENCE:**
This talk is designed for Elixir developers, system architects, and engineers interested in building scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time applications.

It will particularly benefit those who want to deepen their understanding of PubSub, distributed systems, and real-time communication, as well as anyone looking to optimize their use of Phoenix.PubSub in production environments.

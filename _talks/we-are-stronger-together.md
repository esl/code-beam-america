There are more than 30 languages running on the BEAM, and over a dozen of Erlang VM implementations. Bright minds spending countless hours adding pieces to the puzzle. How does it contribute to ecosystem success?  
  
Being fragmented, the ecosystem is not as strong as it deserves. We can join forces and work together to make the ecosystem thrive. It takes courage to abandon OTP fork convenience, but pays off when the community leaps forward with BeamAsm JIT. It requires an effort to refine the upstream contribution but leaves your name in history.  
  
It takes the pride away merging your own project into a larger one. But it helps others to discover your work and build on it.  
  
This talk is a call to action, showing why it is important to focus on improving the ecosystem for everyone. It is easier than it looks, and the talk will explain why.

OBJECTIVES

Unite developers working in and on the ecosystem.

AUDIENCE

Any developer working with BEAM

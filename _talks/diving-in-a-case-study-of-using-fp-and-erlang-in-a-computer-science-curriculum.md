Change can be hard, especially when everyone has input but not detailed experience. At BYU-Idaho we faced an outdated CS undergraduate curriculum that did not meet Higher Education or industry, and therefore student, needs. In a dramatic and complete rewrite of our CS curriculum, Functional Programming and Erlang became a large part of the solution to our problem.

**Talk objectives:**

* Initialize and frame an ongoing discussion with employers to better meet their needs for knowledgeable employees.
* Inform an ongoing discussion with undergraduate and graduate institutions regarding adoption of FP and Erlang in CS curricula.
* Point out roadblocks to and advantages of including FP and Erlang in student learning experiences.
* Help employers know there are students graduating with FP and Erlang experience.

**Target audience:**

* Employers looking for graduates with FP and Erlang experience.
* Undergraduate Educators looking to increase the viability of their students as those students move on to employment or graduate studies.

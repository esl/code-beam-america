This talk explores how abstractions can accelerate production while sacrificing access to critical facilities. It consists of three parts:

1. Contextualizing the Problem: We'll examine challenges in embedded systems, highlighting the transition from microcontrollers to OS and the loss of hardware capabilities.
2. Transitioning from Embedded to Web Deployments: I'll share my journey, emphasizing deployment mistakes made while moving from scripts to tools like Kubernetes and Ansible, leading to the development of DeployEx, an Elixir application.
3. Overview of DeployEx: Finally, I'll discuss the features of this open-source project and its future potential.

**OBJECTIVES:**
- The goal of this talk is to highlight the strengths and capabilities of the Beam, such as distribution and hot code reloading, which are often overlooked by current deployment tools. I will discuss how this oversight can steer Elixir app development away from fully utilizing these features.

**AUDIENCE:**
- All elixir developers in general, since deployex can cover deployments and also metrics, distributions, etc.

        <p>To respond to your requests, we have created Code BEAM e-shop with conference swag!
          <br><br>You can now not only participate in a hybrid experience, but also order t-shirts (included in the in-person ticket!), sweatshirts, mugs and many more items, from the comfort of your couch.
          <br><br>All items are ordered directly with Spreadshirt but are branded with the official Code BEAM America 2022 designs. The store was created for our community but is a third party supplier. Any issues with the items should be directed to the supplier and not Code Sync.

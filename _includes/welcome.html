              <p> Erlang and Elixir share the same Virtual Machine, the BEAM. This ingenious little bit of technology is perfect for fault-tolerant, resilient applications that scale to billions of users, which is one of the biggest challenges facing developers and companies today. Code BEAM has united Erlang & Elixir developers for years to grow and progress the community in the spirit of Share. Learn. Inspire.
          <br><br>

          Share <br>
          Code BEAM is an event where leading developers in Erlang, Elixir and other BEAM based technologies like RabbitMQ share their use cases and success stories to allow us to grow together.

          <br><br>

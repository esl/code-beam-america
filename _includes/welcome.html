              <p> Our goal is simple: to create a vibrant platform where users of Elixir, Erlang, Gleam and other technologies based on BEAM VM can come together to share insights, get feedback on projects, and inspire each other to new heights. 
 
          <br><br>

          Share <br>
          Code BEAM is an event where leading developers in Erlang, Elixir and other BEAM based technologies like RabbitMQ share their use cases and success stories to allow us to grow together.

          <br><br>

          Learn <br>
          We pride ourselves on our connection with community and industry leaders. At Code BEAM events youâ€™ll be the first to learn about new frameworks and applications for the BEAM VM that can increase your productivity and help make your life easier.

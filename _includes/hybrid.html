          <hr/>
          <p>We are coming back to meet with you in Mountain View and we will make sure not only to deliver a great experience, but also that it’s delivered in a safe environment. However, we’re also keeping in mind that by then not everyone will be able to travel, therefore, we’ve decided to make Code BEAM America a hybrid event, combining both an in-person and virtual conference.
            <br/><br/>There will be two different categories of tickets going on sale at the same time - for the in-person conference and training and for virtual conference attendance.

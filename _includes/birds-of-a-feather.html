    </br></br>
 Do you have a topic you’re passionate about or a challenge you’d love to explore with peers? Hosting a BoF session is your chance to bring it to life!

BoF (Birds of a Feather) sessions are informal, attendee-driven discussions where small groups (up to 10 people) gather to dive into shared interests or big questions. No slides, no formalities—just great conversations.

### How It Works:
- Share your topic idea via the submission link included in your welcome email.
- Topics with at least 5 votes will get their own table.
- If your topic is selected, you’ll host the table and guide the discussion.

### Some Pre-Selected Topics:
- **Embedded and Frameworks**
- **Language/Tool Adoption**
- **Domain-Driven Design**
- **Designing for Scalability and Reliability**
- **Technical Debt**

Want to see your topic on this list? Keep an eye on your welcome email for submission details, and rally your peers to vote for your idea!

  <p>Do you have a topic you’re passionate about or a challenge you’d love to explore with peers? Hosting a BoF session is your chance to bring it to life!</p>

  <p>BoF (Birds of a Feather) sessions are informal, attendee-driven discussions where small groups (up to 10 people) gather to dive into shared interests or big questions. No slides, no formalities—just great conversations.</p>

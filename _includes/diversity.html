    <p class="text-content">
      We are pleased to announce that thanks to our sponsor, Erlang Solutions, weâ€™re implementing a Global Community Support Programme for Code BEAM America 2025. The goal of the programme is to broaden access to the conference and offer support to individuals who might not otherwise have the opportunity to attend. By fostering participation from a wide range of backgrounds, this initiative enables the creation of technology that better reflects the needs of a global audience. When people from varied experiences and perspectives are included in designing and developing products, the resulting innovations are more inclusive, impactful, and equitable, ensuring they improve the lives of millions around the world. The Global Community Support Programme also aims to provide opportunities for startups to attend, giving them access to cutting-edge insights and the chance to network with the community. Additionally, it welcomes those transitioning to Erlang and Elixir from other languages, supporting their journey and helping them integrate into the ecosystem. The programme is open to all, with a focus on empowering those who are underrepresented or new to the community.
